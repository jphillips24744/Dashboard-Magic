## Development

## Development Guidelines

### Version Control

We use Git for version control, and follow the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow.

### Code Reviews

All changes to the `main` branch require a pull request and must be reviewed by at least one other developer before being merged.

### Testing

All code should include appropriate unit, integration, and/or end-to-end tests. We use `pytest` for writing tests.

### CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment. All tests must pass and code must meet all defined quality checks before being merged into `main`.

### Coding Standards

We follow PEP 8, the Python community's style guide. We use `flake8` to enforce these standards.

### Documentation

Code should be well-documented, both with comments in the code itself and in separate documentation. We use Sphinx to generate our project documentation.
